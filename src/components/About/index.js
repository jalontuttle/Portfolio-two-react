        My name is Jalon Tuttle, and I am a web developer in the Columbus, Ohio area. My previous work background was in management in the retail setting, and I decided to completely change my career path toward the end of 2021. I have always had a love and passion for technology, and frankly thought that computer coding was cool the way it was portrayed in TV and Movies. Now, I love coding even more and it is my passion to pursue and learn as much as I possibly can. I have had amazing support from my wife and our dog, and made the transition to do something I love!

        Besides coding I have many passions and hobbies in my personal life. I love sports, specifically football and basketball. My favorite team is the Chicago Bears of the NFL. I have an interest in history, especially viking history and Norse mythology. I love Star Wars, anime, and all video games!
